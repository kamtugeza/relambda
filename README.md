# Relambda

The _Relambda_ is a set of packages that allows you to run your [Remix](https://remix.run/) project on [AWS Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)'s.

This packages allows you to build infrastructure without forcing you to use a specific IaC library (how it has been done in `@remix-run/architect`).

**NOTE:** the Remix team won't create libraries like this. You can find more info in that [thread](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/3173#issuecomment-1248735404).

## To Do
